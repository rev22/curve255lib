This library is an evolution of the public domain library by
Daniel J. Bernstein ( http://cr.yp.to/ecdh/curve25519-20050915.tar.gz ).

Unlike the original, which is extremely fast machine code doing most
of the work using floating point registers, this is a portable
implementation using the GMP library.

An implementation of the function in javascript is included in
curve25519.html.

Security note: this implementation is not resistant to timing attacks.

Some test programs are included in the present distribution:

* 'curve25519test': Its output should be identical to that of the
  test-curve25519 program in the curve25519-20050915 library.
  'curve25519test.txt' provides the first 100 lines of output.

* 'curve25519': provides a command-line interface to the curve25519 function,
  usable in scripts or by external programs.  Input and output can be in
  base32, hexadecimal or inverted-byte hexadecimal format (the one
  used in the original library's test program).

  The TESTDUMP file provides sample input and output (to verify the correctness of the
  implementation).


Enjoy!
